      "plot": "In 'Interstellar: Pixel Odyssey,' players take on the role of Cooper, a former NASA pilot turned farmer in a near-future Earth facing a global food crisis. When mysterious gravitational anomalies lead Cooper and his team to a hidden NASA base, they discover a wormhole near Saturn that may hold the key to humanity's survival. Players must navigate through various 2D pixel-art levels, piloting spacecraft, solving physics-based puzzles, and managing resources to explore new worlds on the other side of the wormhole. Along the way, they encounter time dilation effects, alien civilizations, and moral dilemmas as they strive to find a habitable planet for humanity's future. Will players unravel the mysteries of the universe and make the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good?",
